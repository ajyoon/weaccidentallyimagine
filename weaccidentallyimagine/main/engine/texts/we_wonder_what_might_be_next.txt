we wonder what might be next, if anything actually changed over these years or if nothing ever really changes. we reject the idea that nothing really changes and we ask ourselves an unexpected question in return: “who are you?” and we are unable to answer. we don't know. and then we begin to cry. and then we begin to laugh, and laugh, and laugh. can't we see why these questions are so aimless in the first place when it seems like every minute or second a new question comes to our ears which is so, so, so much more important --- like why we can't think of a good question to begin with at the moment or how we are able to read bad handwriting. we laugh, and we laugh, and we laugh.
