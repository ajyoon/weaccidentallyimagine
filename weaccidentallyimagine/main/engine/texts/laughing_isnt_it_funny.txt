laughing! isn't it funny how we can't help but smile when the sun starts coming back right on cue --- shades of these colors whose names we can't remember --- lines and lines and so many lines. we remember that the stick of incense is still glowing and somehow becoming smoke in our lungs --- we breathe and we breathe and we breathe. we forget to ask questions.
