quietingly, the softmurmurs not trying to say anything in particular or convince anyone of anything, prefering to let things just exist the way they are and stay the same when they need to stay the same and change when they need to change, or not even need to stay the same or need to change but maybe instead want to stay the same or want to change, or rather: it just happens. it just happens, and it keeps just happening. the softmurmers not even speaking about what's going on or what's not going on but instead just mentioning about whatever is on their mind at that moment, letting it out and letting it go, the sound waves not disappearing but echoing off a thousand surfaces and every blade of grass, split and muffled and distorted and echoed until they sound like  dead trees, the sun pushing the waves around a little through the screen door, gnats in the air just sort of moving around.
