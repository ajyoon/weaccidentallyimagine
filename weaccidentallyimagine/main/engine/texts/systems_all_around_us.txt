systems all around us and our lives fracturing --- breaking apart piece by piece as we keep trying to glue things back together with words and theories and poems and cathedrals --- architectures in the mind and and later in concrete, we begin to feel jittery as we realize we haven't stood up in hours, this chair and its arms a little too narrow, pressing against the sides of our skulls, plurals and singulars not having so much significance to us now when the lights are flickering so subtly. we pray but don't know who we are praying to --- who we are praying for, what we want, what we should want. fading. fading.
