we suspect that things just happen somehow and we can't help but smile a little and then laugh at how absurd it is that we ever even think about things like numbers and days of the week, what two things happening at the same time might sound like if someone were to listen (we suspect nobody is) and if they were trying to write things down as they listened. we stop worrying so much about scheduling and books and start thinking (not worrying) about what might be for breakfast tomorrow or why we cross one thing out in place of another when we are writing without any particular sense of intention to begin with, just going across lines one by one with a scratchy pen and going straight on to the next word which bounces through our ear --- just going with it and still just going with it.
