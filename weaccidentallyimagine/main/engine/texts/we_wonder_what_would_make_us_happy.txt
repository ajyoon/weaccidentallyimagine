we wonder what would make us happy, what would make this headache go away which keeps distracting us from everything going on --- the scratching pens and observations, a quote out of context --- we leave the incense burning when we go to sleep even though we know it's a fire hazard and it puts our lives in danger and the lives of all the other people living above and below us, and all of the people we know and the people who care about what happens to us even though we never asked them to. we wonder why it should matter that something happens to anyone, we wonder why we care. and everything is so quiet.
