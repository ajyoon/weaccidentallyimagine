all these different circumstances calling for different responses, different ways of dealing and smiling. we are smiling and we don't know why --- because one of us smiled first? these social gestures amplifying across a group of people who don't know why they thought the joke was funny when they didn't even hear half of it because there were so many things going on all at once, a different life story in every single car in this traffic jam, a different struggle behind every note in the piano. maybe if there was more time. but there isn't. the sky seeming like just another ceiling. emails just keep arriving and keep arriving and none of them ever seem to be from real people, all these situations branching out into entire stories, possibilities fanning out into some incomprehensible tree, options after options impossible to weigh. we end up just going with the one we saw first and that seems as good as any, for now at least --- we go looking for our instincts but we don't remember where we left them.
