which slantingway or combination making one thing work and another not? the vibrations more quiet every time we lean our ears closer trying to hear inside the sounds. we are aware of our actions but try not to notice. the sun outside making this fuzzy kind of sound against the grass. we pause and just breathe for a while. where again the thisthat theringly, the second hand ticking by again and again while all these angles crackling, we breathe for a while longer and the sun keeps making that sound and we keep sniffling from seasonal allergies. a bird call we don't recognize. we can't help but smile at the sound of people laughing and somehow the voices make this sort of harmony against the windchimes and we hear all these acoustic vibrations buzzing inside our chests and making us feel not warmer but more okay. more okay.
