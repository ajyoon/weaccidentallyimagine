silence and quiet now. a small voice humming and laughing in the other room. a crystal or some melting snow. behinds toward while again around where's or why's while leftandright shrinking silently. a wooden creak. a scratch. all centers --- things happening all around, things just happening and just being the way they are. and we realize that this is a beautiful thing. that this is a beautiful thing.
