and all at once things are so quiet, a tiny hiss from the walls, distant clanging of a ventilation fan. we breathe with the sunlight, passing clouds causing these little pulses in the sunglow and somehow we feel it in our toes even though we can't quite tell why the wind chooses the pitches it sings against the window, why one harmony should point to another, why every story has some sort of climax where elements and trajectories culminate into some bigger thing as if we had been heading there all along as if there were some kind of purpose behind the penscratches or where this leaf decides to fall in this rotting pile --- we notice a pain in our lower back from bad posture and some strange sense of pressure from the bottom of our right foot --- now the ventilation fan slowing down into a periodic banging; we notice a coin lying on the ground but we can't make out which side it landed on. do we care? is it good to care? would it matter if we knew? we are staring at the coin and the coin is staring back.
