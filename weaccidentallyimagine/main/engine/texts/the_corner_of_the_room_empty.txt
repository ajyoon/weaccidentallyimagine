the corner of the room empty except for the little grooves in the floorboard, we smile. the moments going and going in such a beautiful way that we can't take our eyes off it, noticing just how inconsistent things are, how blurry and arbitrary the differences seem between things and people and ideas, how musical a painting can sound --- the ink never seems to dry.
