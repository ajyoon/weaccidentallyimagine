we close our eyes for a moment and feel like we are floating outside our bodies, that the incense is somehow in our foreheads, that it might be warm enough outside to open the windows now. we breathe and feel this stinging sensation in our hands --- now we notice small dents in the floorboard and ask ourselves where they came from --- what caused each groove and scrape along the wooden panels and walls of paint --- every freckle and scratch on the face of someone we care a lot about, how each knot in the wires behind the desk happened, if someone did it on purpose of if these things just sort of happen on their own somehow.
