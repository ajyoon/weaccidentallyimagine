how did we get here? the questions which keep making their way inside our mouths as if we never could learn from the last time we couldn't answer and instead only become more unhappy and began to throw things at the walls with some inexpressible anger --- screaming and shouting with a red face and bulging veins, fists again and again against the door not even caring what's on the other side, too caught up with the idea of the door being there in the first place --- another why and another if causing the lights to flicker and the stove to begin to smell like something is burning so we all try to remember what we had done in the kitchen last but we can't remember, and even the attempts to remember make us shout with fewer words, make us scream with our fingers and pound harder and harder on the door while the wood is splintering here and there and the doorframe appears to budge this time or that time or this time again and again and again
