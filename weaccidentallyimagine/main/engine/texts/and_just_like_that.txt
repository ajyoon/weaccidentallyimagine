and just like that, the page turns for us. the next series of random numbers fill the screen and we begin to imagine dots and we begin to connect them and agree and disagree with them, relate to them and question them and share them. the page glares. we glare. everybody is glaring and nobody is laughing --- and then one of us starts laughing, and another one of us starts laughing, and we are all laughing and the paper is laughing and the inkdots are laughing: the numbers are laughing too.
