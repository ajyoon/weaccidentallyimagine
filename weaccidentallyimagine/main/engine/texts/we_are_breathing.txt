we are breathing. and we are still breathing. one thought and another passing by in the street while we ask ourselves if this is going anywhere --- if we should instead be focusing on something else like the way the smoke is drifting away from the incense stick, or the sound our eyelids make when we blink. is there a place for rushing anymore? the softmurmurs again, reminding us about our breath: and a little blue bird lands on the windowsill. it is singing.
