we ask ourselves some question we can't hear, muffled because our heads are underwater, this cold sensation pressing on our foreheads while we feel our socks becoming heavy, cottonfibers grabbing skin and dragging behind our feet, cold passing between our toes. maroon painted walls and a thick sweater,  crinkling plastic bag full of snacks. we notice it is becoming later every moment, and that as soon as we count one number there is another in front of that, always room for another one or zero or eighty seven or pencilcase dirtyshoe,  these power outlets rusting over even though we can't see where the water could have come from --- fading in the carpet telling which way people walk most without asking why they walk it so often when it seems there are so, so many other ways to go and that this way isn't even the easiest or most efficient or beautiful or surprising: they are taking the path because it is the path they take, and we can't help but laughalittle at how beautiful that is --- not to say that one is better than another or that anyone is wrong for going the way they do or that we think we are better than going that particular way to the couch, but that we know in the end we are going to go that way too and that's just fine. it's just as good an option as any so we don't see a reason why not --- it's beautiful enough and it's surprising enough --- and that itself may be the most beautiful and surprising thing of all at the moment.
