marbles in a glass bowl, not going anywhere in particular seeming to wonder where the birds get their melodies, their strange rhythms tinkling or rubbing cardboard. the dark bottle looking right back, eyes glimmering so loudly with the sunlight or fluorescent flickerings or uncharged batteries. the lithium looking for water. how's this different? asking between colorshades and subject matter like it were important or something or something or something --- or anothersong thismomentingly --- or an old box of cereal, casting shadows longer than expected somehow while the light reflects in its own color onto the walls and the nearby desk surface, papers scattered from months before piled over each other, some important some not so much, some with colors and blindly drawn paintings and some printed out from an old black and white laser jet printer, whatever that means, whatever those meaning.
