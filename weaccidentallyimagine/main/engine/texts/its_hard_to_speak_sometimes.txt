it's hard to speak sometimes. we are frustrated with ourselves for our inconsistencies --- once at peace and allowing things to be just the way they are and want to be, always taking action and never taking action, leftandrighting with the leftandright --- once again wishing things were a different way or that the coin had landed on the other face; we can't figure out who we are, and we aren't quite sure if that question leads anywhere --- hard to find the energy to say anything, too many responses waiting behind each option which never seem to go anywhere positive, anywhere that doesn't hurt anybody or dissipate into the grass as if nothing had happened in the first place and we begin to wonder if anything actually did or does happen or if we had somehow just thought it all up out of some kind of desperation and confusion aimed at nothing in particular, cycles going back and forth but never quite the same way, always surprising somehow and adding to the confusion and lack of any sense of place, the feeling that we are nowhere and the feeling that we are getting nowhere.
