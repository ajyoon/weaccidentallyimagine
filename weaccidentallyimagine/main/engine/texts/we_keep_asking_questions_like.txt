we keep asking questions like “will this make me happy?” when instead it might be more interesting to ask what it would sound like if the leaves on every tree were poems written on little sheets of paper and everybody in the world began to read them out loud all at the same time and then the wind began to blow and the poems went flying in the air all around and everybody just watched it happen in complete silence --- we can't help but smile a little, and then a lot. and someone hugs the stranger to their left and we all begin to laugh. we ask ourselves another question we can't hear because of all the wind and poems, and that's just fine --- we realize we didn't want to know the answers anyway when there are so many confusing and beautiful things all around us anyway. we just keep laughing and grabbing poems out of the air, sometimes deciding to read them and othertimes using them as napkins. the wind, the wind is laughing too.
