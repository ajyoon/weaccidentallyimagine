which whyhow thumpingly against the doors, the momentnow changing and growing, shapes never leading to ones we expect in situations where things might make sense of some kind. we remember that things don't have to make sense, that things can be left just as they happen --- we remember that consistency is another sort of illusion and that taking a step away could even mean allowing things which don't make sense to happen --- not so much difference between our own actions and the temperature outside today, not so much difference between our minds and our shoelaces --- tied or untied, on or off or tangled up in a trashbag somewhere near spoiled food being eaten by bacteria and fungi --- we remember that having no control over the world also means having no control over ourselves, our thoughts, our actions, and that this is a beautiful thing. this is a beautiful thing. this is a beautiful thing and that's completely okay if we let it be, if we watch the pollen drift to the ground, following a single green speck in its strange path --- at the same time together with the crowd and completely separate, at the same time going somewhere with a goal and just falling in the air's path, standing around for hours supposedly doing some job playing some role in this thing we call society, vaguely defined values being pushed on everyone even when we don't quite understand what anyone is saying or why they are saying it or and we ourselves don't quite understand what we ourselves are saying or why we are saying it --- the wind still saying something outside, the sun's belly still rising and falling with every breath as it thinks about wooden cabinets and why they are shaped the way they are when there are so many possibilities, so many ways to write a poem or explain a thought, so many ways to build a chord and roll up our sleeves when it seems everyday that there is a new color in the sky, a new piece of garbage on our desks. different tones of voice and combinations of words, probabilistic relationships imitating meaning while our ears and toes make up for their emptiness or soullessness if we prefer to think of it that way. the illusion breaking down again, a smallvoiced reminder that we are a pale blue dot, a grain of sand out of place in a library where every book is in a different language and there are pictures of things we don't recognize or have names for even when we thought we had a good grip on shapes and colors; we are not sure if the shuffling feet a few shelves down is a librarian or an old friend we haven't seen in a long time whose name we don't remember even though years ago we had laughed until the sun came back --- or maybe the sound is from an old cell phone left playing music, or the ventilation fans turning back on --- we remember that the galaxies themselves are asking questions of their own, wondering where they are hurtling toward, wondering when it will finally stop for a minute  ---
