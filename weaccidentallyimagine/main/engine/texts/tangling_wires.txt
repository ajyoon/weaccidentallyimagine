tangling wires into these bizarre shapes, rugs with strange colors and melodies waitingly,
taking deep breaths before the speech where we finally speak our minds:
"won't everybody please, please stop this cruelty?
	can't we see how unnecessary it is?"

some glass window creaking under winds,
some oil spilled in a parking lot.
|||
how again the why's and who's before and after or some <i>some</i> behind throughingly, a manual for writers of research papers about electrical engineering and game theory, complex analysis and early marxist painting; <i><b>the walls of this place have shoulders that are sagging,</b></i> somewhere in these pages an actual answer to a question that matters. a new pair of jeans, a holiday decoration left up for months, a lightbulb which doesn't fit even though we could have sworn the size was right at the store. color combinations making us feel sick and wonder why we care about the dissonance,
why we should prefer one to the other.
we conclude that we're all just bits of air moving with the waves of some song we can't hear:
now banging on the wooddrums,
the thoughts and the doubts,
hopes or imaginations throwing fists at the organ keyboard,
some body of loud waters,
some electrical structure groaning in rains ---
particles trapped in the breezings,
the sine waves, the eyeballs thrown left and right or up and down --- <i><b>or is that a sign of happiness, of peacefulness?</b></i> who's to tell what's harmony and what's dissonance? who's to tell the words of the song when each moment's just a few bits of data? --- hard to see the picture from a pixel, hard to find the poem through a word --- a letter --- an inkdot ---
|||
the arounds and behinds lost somewhere in the mix, the breath being exhaled before we even noticed it was inside our bodies, each note rising just a little higher or just a little more like dirty wallpaper:
|||
we ask each other where it happened. where the music got faster. where the blue became  green, where the light was switched on and the newer waves began to interfere with things and distort the shapes, canceling out or multiplying or performing more complicated operations until the noise is noise and the signal is noise and the noise is still noise yet somehow wider, more sideways and spinningly and uppingly and backwardly, more harsh and out of sync,

now neon colorlines and batteries, strange gaps in the spiral --- not patterns but something about them which makes us feel the walls are moving further away and the room is becoming smaller, that one moment is another and the second hand is somehow different this time around. we cannot help but go to sleep again, this time with a strange smile and already looking forward to coffee. this time with socks and a thicker blanket. this time with the windows open: and in comes the cooler air.
